            // 1. A single container mentioned by div with css class 'slidecontainer'. There may be many slidecontainers in a single page, each having different number of slides.
            // 2. Then inside of that div with 'slidecontainer' css class, place another div with css class as 'slidezimple'
            // 3.Inside the div with css class 'slidezimple', we are going to create few slides.
            // 4. Create a div with css classes 'slides slide0' inside the 'slidezimple' div.This completes our first slide.
            // 5. Create a div with css classes 'slides slide1' inside the same 'slidezimple' div.This completes our second slide.
            // 6. You can add as many slides you can by repeating the step4 or step5 again.
            // The basic structure looks like this:
